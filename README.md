# DevilutionX - With Blackjack... and Hookers:
This is a simple fork of Diasurgical's amazing DevilutionX source. I wanted to play the original Diablo with friends, but I couldn't find a DevilutionX mod with all the fixes and tweaks I wanted... So I made my own.

What's in here:

- Changed max gold limit from 5000 to 50000
- Disabled gold and gear drop on death (Don't judge. My boys suck at this game.)
- Disable friendly fire (by [@majek](https://github.com/majek/devilutionX/commits?author=majek))
- Color outline of multiplayer characters (by [@majek](https://github.com/majek/devilutionX/commits?author=majek))
- Draw all players on automap and color dead players diferently (by [@majek](https://github.com/majek/devilutionX/commits?author=majek))
- Introduce communism (Hehaha!). Divide gained exp equally against all players (by [@majek](https://github.com/majek/devilutionX/commits?author=majek))
- Run in town (by [@Manuel-K](https://github.com/Manuel-K/devilutionX-QOL-patches))
- Highlight items (by [@Manuel-K](https://github.com/Manuel-K/devilutionX-QOL-patches))
- Monster HP bar (by [@Manuel-K](https://github.com/Manuel-K/devilutionX-QOL-patches))
- Bump multiplayer to 16 players (by [@AJenbo](https://github.com/diasurgical/devilutionX/pull/551/files))
- Add fix to allow all unique items to drop (by [@ghost](https://github.com/diasurgical/devilutionX/pull/540/files))
